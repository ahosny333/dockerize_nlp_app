## 1. Project Planning & Management

### **Project Proposal**

**Overview:**  
This project aims to automate the evaluation of articles (e.g., news, blogs, research papers) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, integrated with DevOps tools for seamless deployment, monitoring, and scalability. The goal is to build a system that analyzes article quality, sentiment, relevance, and readability, while ensuring fast delivery and reliable updates through DevOps practices.  

**Objectives:**  

1. Develop an NLP model to evaluate articles based on predefined criteria.  
2. Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, deployment, and updates.  
3. Ensure system reliability and scalability using cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Docker).  
4. Deliver a user-friendly interface or API for end-users to submit and retrieve evaluations.  

**Scope:**  

- **Included:** Model training, pipeline automation, cloud deployment, basic dashboard for results.  
- **Excluded:** Content creation, advanced user authentication, or multilingual support (phase 1).

## 2. Literature Review

### **Feedback & Evaluation**  

The lecturer’s assessment of the project highlighted the following:  

- **Strengths:**  
  - Successful integration of NLP and DevOps tools (Docker, GitHub Actions) to create a portable, automated system.  
  - Clear documentation in the GitHub repo, especially the `Dockerfile` and workflow examples.  
  - Practical focus on reproducibility, making it easy for users to deploy the app locally.  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Limited scope of NLP evaluation (e.g., basic sentiment/readability checks) compared to advanced models like BERT or GPT.  
  - Minimal testing coverage (e.g., no unit tests for edge cases like very long articles or non-English text).  
  - UI/API lacks features like user history or export options.  

### **Suggested Improvements**

Based on feedback, the project could be enhanced by:  

1. **Expanding NLP Capabilities:**
   - Add support for topic modeling, fact-checking, or bias detection using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers.  
   - Include multilingual evaluation (e.g., using spaCy’s language pipelines).  
2. **Strengthening DevOps Practices:**  
   - Add monitoring (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) to track API performance and model accuracy over time.  
   - Optimize Docker images for production (e.g., reduce image size, use Alpine Linux).  
3. **Improving User Experience:**  
   - Build a simple dashboard (Streamlit/Flask) to visualize evaluation results.  
   - Add user authentication for secure API access.  
4. **Testing & Scalability:**  
   - Write unit/integration tests for the NLP model and API endpoints.
   - Test deployment on cloud platforms (AWS ECS, Kubernetes) for scalability.

### **Final Grading Criteria**

The project will be graded based on:

1. **Documentation (25%):**
   - Clarity of setup instructions, code comments, and repo structure.  
   - Inclusion of troubleshooting guides and FAQs.  
2. **Implementation (30%):**

**MVP Notes:**  
These requirements focus on delivering a ***minimum viable product (MVP)*** that works reliably, with room to grow (e.g., adding advanced NLP models or authentication). The GitHub repo’s existing structure (Dockerfiles, CI/CD workflows) aligns closely with these goals, ensuring the project stays practical and user-focused. 🛠️
